# Odin-Recipes
This is my first project for *The Odin Project* curriculum. It represents my return to web development after several years, dusting off the HTML and CSS knowledge I first acquired when I was 16.

## 🚀 About the Project
While the original assignment focused primarily on basic HTML, I decided to push myself further by implementing *custom CSS* to create a clean, modern, and professional aesthetic.

### Key Learnings & Refreshed Concepts:
* *File Structure:* Managing a clean workspace with dedicated directories for images, recipes, and styles.
* *Flexbox Layouts:* Implementing a responsive gallery on the homepage to align recipe cards horizontally.
* *Advanced Positioning:* Using position: relative and absolute to create elegant text overlays on top of recipe images.
* *UI Consistency:* Developing a "main style class" to ensure a unified look and feel across all subpages.

## 📸 Features
* *Homepage:* A visual gallery with hover effects and centered cards.
* *Recipe Pages:* Organized layouts featuring ingredient lists (<ul>) and ordered preparation steps (<ol>).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox & Positioning)
