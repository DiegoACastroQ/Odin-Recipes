            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                Shrimp Risotto (Risotto ai Gamberi) is a sophisticated Italian dish originating 
                from Northern Italy. It is celebrated for its creamy, velvety consistency, which 
                is achieved through a specific cooking technique rather than the addition of cream. By slowly 
                adding warm broth to starchy Arborio or Carnaroli rice and stirring constantly, the rice
                 releases its natural starches. The dish combines the delicate sweetness of fresh shrimp with aromatics like garlic, shallots, 
                 and a splash of dry white wine for a balanced, luxurious meal.

                 <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                 <ul>
                  <li>​300g Fresh shrimp (peeled and deveined)</li>
                  <li>1 liter Seafood or Vegetable broth (kept warm on the stove)</li>
                  <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
                  <li>2 cloves Garlic, minced</li>
                  <li>300g Arborio or Carnaroli rice</li>
                  <li>1 small Shallot, finely diced</li>
                  <li>​1/2 cup Dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)</li>
                  <li>30g Unsalted butter</li>
                  <li>​1/4 cup Freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                  <li>Fresh parsley, chopped</li>

                 </ul>

                    <h4>Steps</h4>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Sauté the Shrimp: In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and shrimp. Cook for 1-2 minutes per side until pink. Remove the shrimp from the pan and set them aside.</li>
                      <li>Toast the Rice: In the same pan, add the diced shallots (add a little more oil if needed). Sauté until translucent. Add the rice and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the edges of the rice look translucent.</li>
                      <li>​Deglaze: Pour in the white wine. Stir until the liquid has been completely absorbed by the rice.</li>
                      <li>The Risotto Method: Add a ladleful of the warm broth to the rice. Stir frequently. Once the liquid is almost fully absorbed, add another ladle. Continue this process for about 18-20 minutes.</li>
                      <li>​Check Consistency: The rice should be al dente—tender but with a slight bite in the center—and the texture should be creamy, not dry.</li>
                      <li>The "Mantecatura" (Finishing): Turn off the heat. Stir in the butter, Parmesan cheese, and the cooked shrimp. This step creates the final creamy texture.</li>
                      <li>Garnish: Add chopped parsley and a final crack of black pepper. Serve immediately on a warm plate.</li>
