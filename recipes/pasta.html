            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                ​Pasta Carbonara is a classic Roman pasta dish known for its creamy texture and rich, savory flavor. Unlike many international versions, the authentic Italian recipe does not use cream. Instead,
                 the "sauce" is created by combining raw eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, and starchy pasta water, which emulsify into a silky coating.
                 The dish is finished with crispy pieces of guanciale (cured pork jowl) or pancetta and a generous amount of freshly cracked black pepper.

                 <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                 <ul>
                    <li>200g Spaghetti or Rigatoni</li>
                    <li>​100g Guanciale (or Pancetta/thick-cut bacon)</li>
                    <li>2 Large eggs (plus 1 extra egg yolk for extra creaminess)</li>
                    <li>50g Pecorino Romano cheese (freshly grated)</li>
                    <li>​Salt (for the pasta water)</li>
                    <li>​Freshly cracked black pepper</li>

                    <h4>Steps</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Boil the Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until it is al dente (usually 1-2 minutes less than the package instructions).</li>
                        <li>Crisp the Pork: While the pasta cooks, add the diced guanciale or pancetta to a cold pan. Turn the heat to medium and fry until the fat has rendered and the pork is golden and crispy. Remove from heat, but keep the rendered fat in the pan.</li>
                        <li>​Prepare the "Cream": In a small bowl, whisk the eggs, the extra yolk, and the grated Pecorino Romano together. Add a lot of black pepper. This creates a thick paste.</li>
                        <li>Combine: Once the pasta is ready, reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water, then drain the spaghetti. Toss the pasta into the pan with the crispy pork and the rendered fat. Mix well to coat.  </li>
                        <li>The Tempering (Crucial Step): Ensure the pan is not on the heat (to avoid scrambling the eggs). Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta. Toss quickly and vigorously.</li>
                        <li>Emulsify: Add a few splashes of the reserved pasta water while tossing. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs gently, turning the mixture into a creamy, glossy sauce.</li>
                        <li>Serve: Plate immediately and top with a little more cheese and black pepper.</li> 
                    </ol>
