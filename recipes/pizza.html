         <h3>Description</h3>
         <p> 
            Pepperoni pizza is a timeless classic and a staple of Italian-American cuisine. It consists of a fermented dough base topped with a savory tomato sauce,
             a generous layer of melted mozzarella cheese, and thin slices of pepperoni. Pepperoni is a dry-cured, spicy sausage made from
             beef and pork, seasoned with paprika and chili flakes. When baked at high temperatures, the pepperoni slices 
            become crispy and release a flavorful oil that seasons the entire pizza.

                    <h4>Steps</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>​Prepare the Yeast: Mix the warm water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Let it sit for about 10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                        <li>Mix the Dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Create a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
                        <li>Knead: Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes until the texture is smooth and elastic.</li>
                        <li>​First Rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until it doubles in size.</li>
                        <li>​Shape the Pizza: Preheat your oven to its highest setting (usually 250°C / 480°F). Punch the dough down to release air and stretch it into a circle on a baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
                        <li>Add Toppings: Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the sauce, then arrange the pepperoni slices on top. Sprinkle with a bit of oregano.</li>
                        <li>​Bake: Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly charred.</li>
                        <li>Serve: Let it cool for a couple of minutes, slice it, and enjoy!</li>
